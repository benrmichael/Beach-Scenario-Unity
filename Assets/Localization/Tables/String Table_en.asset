      see a Sphere like the one to the right.


      This Sphere detects your gaze.
      Try looking at it to see the color change. Green means you are looking, red
      means you are not.


      Your job will be to follow the sphere with your
      eyes as best you can. Let our team member know you when you are ready.'
